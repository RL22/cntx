# cntx
Cntx is a contact application with CRUD (create, read, update & delete) capabilities, built with AngularJS &amp; Firebase cloud database.

#Specs
The <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">Angular-Seed</a> boilerplate was used to kick-off development. I added Firebase via Angularfire for the CRUD capabilities and Foundation 5 for responsivness and styling. 
#Reqs

#Installing Dependencies 

From the project root directory run "npm install" which auto-runs (bower install) as directed in packages.json file scripts. Once the dev dependencies have installed run "npm start" to get the server running on port localhost:8000.
